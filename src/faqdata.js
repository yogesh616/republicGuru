  You can make better shopping decisions through our powerful Shopping Assistant available for Chrome Browser and Android app.
  
  **Where does Cashback money come from?**  
  RepublicGuru is an affiliate marketing company. This means that when you shop via us on our partner stores, we get paid a "commission" by the store. We give 70-100% of this commission to you as cashback. 
  
  In short - The store pays & thanks us for getting a customer, and we pay & thank you for choosing us.
  
  We aim to create a generation of smart shoppers by empowering customers to make the best possible choices. We sweeten everyday deals and make online shopping more rewarding.

Make sure you are logged into your RepublicGuru account.
Check cashback rates for the store to ensure the category you are shopping for has cashback.
Make sure you AdBlock is disabled as it is known to interfere with tracking

    summary: "Why is tracked pending cashback only an estimate?",

This is because when a transaction is tracked, most stores do not provide us with all the information required to accurately track cashback. Without the exact purchase amount, product category, new or existing user, etc. details from the store, there is no way for us to know the exact cashback at this stage.

For Example, Jabong's cashback depends on whether you are a new user or an existing user at Jabong. Other factors like the platform used (Desktop / App / Mobile web etc.), and the specific product category for the item you have purchased also affect the cashback rate. So we display the estimated cashback amount you might get as your tracked cashback.

On confirmation, the final confirmed cashback can be lower or higher, depending on the various factors mentioned above. In case you feel your cashback transaction was confirmed for an incorrect amount, please submit a Claim for Incorrect Amount.`

In 4-8 weeks, this amount should get updated to confirmed once the merchant approves the purchase.`

2. "CONFIRMED" cashback (Merchant pays us a commission, we pay you cashback): After the return/exchange period is over, the merchant validates that the sale meets cashback terms & conditions (See "Useful Tips" section on the store page) This can take 4-8 weeks depending on when the store pays us commission.

Cashback status update is a two step process as shown below:



Merchants take a long period of 60-90 days because they check multiple things before paying us the commissions:

1. They wait for the return/exchange period to get over 

2. The check that the sale meets the terms and conditions of cashback

3. They check if the user is legitimate or fraud buyer

4. They prefer to do  checks for multiple users at the same time in bulk, mostly at the end of a month

At our end, we pay you the cashback as soon as we get our commission to minimize further delay. As you can see, the majority of the delay is beyond our control though we continue to work with stores to reduce this waiting period.

In case your cashback is pending even after 60 days from the date of purchase, file a claim under 'Cashback Pending For Too Long' and we will try to expedite it with the store.`

The order was exchanged or partially exchanged.
The order was changed.
The order was paid for using a gift code or gift voucher.
The order was paid for using Cash on Delivery.

The order did not comply with the store's cashback policy. To see details on store specific cashback policy please see the 'Useful Tips' section on RepublicGuru Store pages.
 

When cashback is cancelled by the retailer, the following will happen:

1. Your cancelled cashback amount of that transaction will be deducted from your pending balance.

2. The status of the transaction will be set to "cancelled" in your cashback activity page.

If you still think your cashback was cancelled wrongly by the merchant, you can file a claim under 'Cashback Cancelled' category'.
